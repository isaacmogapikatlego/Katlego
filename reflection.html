<h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
<p>Transitioning from high school to tertiary education has been a profound period of growth and adaptation.Stepping into tertiary i was faced with a new level of independence I had to learn how to manage my time, study independently, and balance multiple subjects. At first, it was overwhelming but experiencing it first hand is a uniquely humbling and transformative process, but I developed habits like setting daily goals and reviewing lessons after each class has helped me throughout this semester because unlike in highschool where my schedule where meticulously planned for me by my teachers  here in college no one is here to remind me to start an assignment or to structure my day these are the things i had to learn all by myself inorder to survive varsity .</p>
<p> A key breakthrough in my learning was embracing the power of collaboration .I learned to ask for help which was a game changer for me because before that i would be just banging my head against a wall stuck on the same problem for hours but now through that learned concept hearing how someone else has interpreted some materials would make it click in a way it never did which is way bettter than trying to do it alone.Group discussions and digital tools have helped me improve. I now use online resources to support my learning and track my progress like Notion calender that allows me track my deadlines and help me stay well on track. I’ve learned that consistency matters more than long study hours.</p>
<p>This semester has taught me discipline and self-awareness, i learned that true discipline is the commitment to consitent focused effort rather than relying on last minute studdy sessions which I believe are key to academic success and future professional growth.</p>
