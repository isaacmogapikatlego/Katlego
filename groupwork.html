<h2>Reflection on Group Work</h2>
<p>This semester,i had the opportunity to wok on a group project for Communication and study skills module that provided a practical lesson in communication and collaboration.reflecting on the process  through tuckman's stages of group development,forming ,storming ,morming ,performing and  adjourning captures our teams evaluation.Our group was formed during the first week of the semester by our lecturer. At first, we were still learning about each other discussing our general strenghts that could benefit the whole group towards our final presentation day (Forming). When tasks started, we had challenges with navigating members opinions without causing resentments in which was solved by allowing every member to have a chance to voice out their percective without onterrrupting (Storming).</p>
<p>As weeks passed, we began understanding each other’s strengths (Norming) we functioned effectively as a unit and supporting each other to meet our goals (Performing). By the end, everyone contributed equally, and we closed our project through an online meeting to congradulate each other on the hardwork and reflect on whatwe have accomplished (Adjourning).</p>
<p>This experience improved my teamwork, patience, and communication. I learned that leadership is not about control but about understanding and support.</p>
