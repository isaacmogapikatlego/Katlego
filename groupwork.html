<h2>Reflection on Group Work</h2>
<p>Our group was formed during the first week of the semester. At first, we were still learning about each other (Forming). When tasks started, disagreements appeared about who should lead (Storming), but we learned to listen and share ideas.</p>
<p>As weeks passed, we began understanding each other’s strengths (Norming) and worked more smoothly on projects (Performing). By the end, everyone contributed equally, and we closed our project with pride (Adjourning).</p>
<p>This experience improved my teamwork, patience, and communication. I learned that leadership is not about control but about understanding and support.</p>
